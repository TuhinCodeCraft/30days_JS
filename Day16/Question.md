# Day 16: Recursion

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Basic Recursion

- __Task 1:__ Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number. Log the result for a few test cases.

- __Task 2:__ Write a recursive function to calculate the nth Fibonacci number. Log the result for a few test cases.

### Activity 2: Recursion with Arrays

- __Task 3:__ Write a recursive function to find the sum of all elements in an array. Log the result for a few test cases.

- __Task 4:__ Write a recursive function to find the maximum element in an array. Log the result for a few test cases.

### Activity 3: String Manipulation with Recursion

- __Task 5:__ Write a recursive function to reverse a string. Log the result for a few test cases.

- __Task 6:__ Write a recursive function to check if a string is a palindrome. Log the result for a few test cases.

### Activity 4: Recursive Search

- __Task 7:__ Write a recursive function to perform a binary search on a sorted array. Log the index of the target element for a few test cases.

- __Task 8:__ Write a recursive function to count the occurrences of a target element in an array. Log the result for a few test cases.

### Activity 5: Tree Traversal (Optional)

- __Task 9:__ Write a recursive function to perform an in-order traversal of a binary tree. Log the nodes as they are visited. 
- __Task 10:__ Write a recursive function to calculate the depth of a binary tree. Log the result for a few test cases.
