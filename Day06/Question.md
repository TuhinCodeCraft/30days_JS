# Day 6: Arrays

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Array Creation and Access

- __Task 1:__ Create an array of numbers from 1 to 5 and log the array to the console.

- __Task 2:__ Access the first and last elements of the array and log them to the console.

### Activity 2: Array Methods (Basic)

- __Task 3:__ Use the push method to add a new number to the end of the array and log the updated array.

- __Task 4:__ Use the pop method to remove the last element from the array and log the updated array.

- __Task 5:__ Use the shift method to remove the first element from the array and log the updated array.

- __Task 6:__ Use the unshift method to add a new number to the beginning of the array and log the updated array.

### Activity 3: Array Methods (Intermediate)

- __Task 7:__ Use the map method to create a new array where each number is doubled and log the new array.

- __Task 8:__ Use the filter method to create a new array with only even numbers and log the new array.

- __Task 9:__ Use the reduce method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array and log the result.

### Activity 4: Array Iteration

- __Task 10__: Use a for loop to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.

- __Task 11__: Use the forEach method to iterate over the array and log each element to the console.

### Activity 5: Multi-dimensional Arrays

- __Task 12__: Create a two-dimensional array (matrix) and log the entire array to the console.

- __Task 13__: Access and log a specific element from the two-dimensional array.
