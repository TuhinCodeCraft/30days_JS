# Day 12: Error Handling

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Basic Error Handling with Try-Catch

- __Task 1:__ Write a function that intentionally throws an error and use a try-catch block to handle the error and log an appropriate message to the console.

- __Task 2:__ Create a function that divides two numbers and throws an error if the denominator is zero. Use a try-catch block to handle this error.

### Activity 2: Finally Block

- __Task 3:__ Write a script that includes a try-catch block and a finally block. Log messages in the try, catch, and finally blocks to observe the execution flow.

### Activity 3: Custom Error Objects

- __Task 4:__ Create a custom error class that extends the built-in Error class. Throw an instance of this custom error in a function and handle it using a try-catch block.

- __Task 5:__ Write a function that validates user input (e.g., checking if a string is not empty) and throws a custom error if the validation fails. Handle the custom error using a try-catch block.

### Activity 4: Error Handling in Promises

- __Task 6:__ Create a promise that randomly resolves or rejects. Use.catch() to handle the rejection and log an appropriate message to the console. 
- __Task 7:__ Use try-catch within an async function to handle errors from a promise that randomly resolves or rejects, and log the error message.

### Activity 5: Graceful Error Handling in Fetch

- __Task 8:__ Use the fetch API to request data from an invalid URL and handle the error using.catch(). Log an appropriate error message to the console.

- __Task 9:__ Use the fetch API to request data from an invalid URL within an async function and handle the error using try-catch. Log an appropriate error message.
