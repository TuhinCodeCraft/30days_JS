# Day 11: Promises and Async/Await

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Understanding Promises

- __Task 1:__ Create a promise that resolves with a message after a 2-second timeout and log the message to the console.

- __Task 2:__ Create a promise that rejects with an error message after a 2-second timeout and handle the error using.catch().

### Activity 2: Chaining Promises

- __Task 3:__ Create a sequence of promises that simulate fetching data from a server. Chain the promises to log messages in a specific order.

### Activity 3: Using Async/Await

- __Task 4:__ Write an async function that waits for a promise to resolve and then logs the resolved value.

- __Task 5:__ Write an async function that handles a rejected promise using try-catch and logs the error message.

### Activity 4: Fetching Data from an API

- __Task 6:__ Use the fetch API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using promises.

- __Task 7:__ Use the fetch API to get data from a public API and log the response data to the console using async/await.

### Activity 5: Concurrent Promises

- __Task 8:__ Use Promise.all to wait for multiple promises to resolve and then log all their values.

- __Task 9:__ Use Promise.race to log the value of the first promise that resolves among multiple promises.
