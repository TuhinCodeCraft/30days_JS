# Day 17: Data Structures

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Linked List

- __Task 1:__ Implement a Node class to represent an element in a linked list with properties value and next.

- __Task 2:__ Implement a LinkedList class with methods to add a node to the end, remove a node from the end, and display all nodes.

### Activity 2: Stack

- __Task 3:__ Implement a Stack class with methods push (add element), pop (remove element), and peek (view the top element).

- __Task 4:__ Use the Stack class to reverse a string by pushing all characters onto the stack and then popping them off.

### Activity 3: Queue

- __Task 5:__ Implement a Queue class with methods enqueue (add element), dequeue (remove element), and front (view the first element). 
- __Task 6:__ Use the Queue class to simulate a simple printer queue where print jobs are added to the queue and processed in order.

### Activity 4: Binary Tree

- __Task 7:__ Implement a TreeNode class to represent a node in a binary tree with properties value, left, and right.

- __Task 8:__ Implement a Binary Tree class with methods for inserting values and performing in-order traversal to display nodes.

### Activity 5: Graph (Optional)

- __Task 9:__ Implement a Graph class with methods to add vertices, add edges, and perform a breadth-first search (BFS).

- __Task 10:__ Use the Graph class to represent a simple network and perform BFS to find the shortest path between two nodes.
