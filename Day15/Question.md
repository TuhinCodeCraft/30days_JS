# Day 15: Closures

## Tasks/Activities:

### Activity 1: Understanding Closures

- __Task 1:__ Write a function that returns another function, where the inner function accesses a variable from the outer function's scope. Call the inner function and log the result.

- __Task 2:__ Create a closure that maintains a private counter. Implement functions to increment and get the current value of the counter.

### Activity 2: Practical Closures

- __Task 3:__ Write a function that generates unique IDs. Use a closure to keep track of the last generated ID and increment it with each call.

- __Task 4:__ Create a closure that captures a user's name and returns a function that greets the user by name.

### Activity 3: Closures in Loops

- __Task 5:__ Write a loop that creates an array of functions. Each function should log its index when called. Use a closure to ensure each function logs the correct index.

### Activity 4: Module Pattern

- __Task 6:__ Use closures to create a simple module for managing a collection of items. Implement methods to add, remove, and list items.

### Activity 5: Memoization

- __Task 7:__ Write a function that memoizes the results of another function. Use a closure to store the results of previous computations.

- __Task 8:__ Create a memoized version of a function that calculates the factorial of a number.
